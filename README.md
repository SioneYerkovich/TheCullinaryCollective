# ‚ÑπÔ∏è **Overview**

Welcome to The Cullinary Collective web application designed and developed by Sione Yerkovich.

This application was designed as an interactive recipe forum/social media mesh. The website has considered many features over its development, with the core features being as follows:

1. Navigation Bar: Streamlined access to the core features of the website: Recipe category navigation, search feature, The Recipe Book and a dynamic Log in/ Log out button
2. The Recipe Book: Here users can upload their own recipes to the recipe book. Submitted recipes get added to "The Collective" and become available for other users to find when using the search feature. This is also where favourited recipes are stored
3. Search feature: Users can search for existing recipes across the collective, this includes keywords such as "dinner" and specifics such as "steak"
4. Log-in/registration menu's that validate user details against the database
5. A password recovery system for forgotten passwords
6. Like system: users can engage with the community by liking recipes, this is tallied and displayed with the recipe details
7. Review feature: Submit reviews for recipes you love, or think need some improvement
8. Favourites: Users can favourite recipes for quick access. These are added to the favourites section in The Recipe Book
9. User friendly UI

# üöÄ **Tech Stack**

I built this site using Bootstrap, HTML, CSS, Python and Django.

I utilised ***HTML*** to build the overall skeleton of every component/page. Django was used for object-relational mapping while integrating the database; Python was used to access and manipulate the data population for things such as conditional views.

***PYTHON*** programming logic was integrated to provide logic to these pages, including what elements are displayed and under what conditions. It allowed me to cross communicate with the Django framework for features such as database creation/manipulation, error handling and page views.

***CSS and BOOTSTRAP*** allowed me to create user-friendly designs that adhere to various design principles.

# üåü **Dependencies**

To run the application, you must install the following:
- Django==5.1.7
- django-widget-tweaks==1.5.0
- pillow==11.1.0
