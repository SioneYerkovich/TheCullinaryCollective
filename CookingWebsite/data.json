    "Name": "BUTTERMILK PANCAKES",

    "author": "Sam Merritt",
    "description": "Buttermilk pancakes are an American classic breakfast food, but despite their unfussy ingredient list, too often people grab for the box mix because it’s just “easier”. Too many home bakers have struggled with dense, flat, or rubbery pancakes, or ones that have charred exteriors, raw centers, or are just all-around lacking in flavor. Today we’re going to fix that with my favorite, fool-proof buttermilk pancake recipe.",
    "ingredients": "- 2 cups all-purpose flour (250g)\r\n- 3 tablespoons sugar\r\n- 2 teaspoons baking powder\r\n- ½ teaspoon baking soda\r\n- ½ teaspoon salt\r\n- 2 ¼ cups buttermilk¹ (530ml)\r\n- 2 large eggs lightly beaten, room temperature preferred\r\n- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract\r\n- 4 Tablespoons unsalted butter melted and cooled (57g)",
    "instructions": "1. In a large bowl, whisk together flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt, until well-combined.  \r\n\r\n2. In a separate, medium-sized bowl, whisk together buttermilk,, eggs, and vanilla extract.\r\n\r\n3. Take your melted butter and slowly drizzle it into your wet ingredients while whisking, stirring until well-combined (the butter may separate and curdle if your other ingredients are cold, this is OK, just whisk to combine).  \r\n\r\n4. Pour wet ingredients into dry ingredients and use a wooden spoon to stir until just combined — do not overmix your pancake batter or your pancakes will be flat.  Use a light hand when stirring, and a few flour streaks in the batter are fine.\r\n\r\n5. Spray a non-stick skillet with cooking spray or lightly brush with canola oil and place on burner on medium-low heat.  \r\n\r\n6. Allow skillet to preheat before adding batter (about 5 minutes, it's good for your pancake batter to sit several minutes as well, which is why you prepared that before preheating your pan), and once skillet is heated (I usually test this by hovering my hand several inches above the pan and making sure I can feel the heat radiating from it) scoop pancake batter into pan (I use about ½-⅔ cup of batter per pancake).  \r\n\r\n7. Allow pancake to cook until edges begin to appear cooked and bubbles in batter begin to burst.  Using a pancake spatula, carefully flip pancake and continue to cook several more minutes until pancake is golden brown.  \r\n\r\n8. Repeat until all batter is used — I recommend spraying or brushing the pan between each batch of pancakes.\r\n\r\n9. Serve warm topped with salted butter and maple syrup!",

    "description": "Salmon Eggs Benedict is a dreamy, indulgent recipe that’s perfect for a slow breakfast meal or a festive brunch event. Smoked salmon, poached eggs, toasted English muffin, and a homemade hollandaise sauce come together for a decadent dish that’s still surprisingly simple to pull together. Reach for this recipe the next time you want to treat yourself or impress a crowd.",
    "ingredients": "- 2 English muffins OR 2 hash brown patties\r\n- ½ cup unsalted butter or vegan butter\r\n- 3 egg yolks\r\n- 2 tablespoons lemon juice\r\n- Salt to taste\r\n- 1 teaspoon Dijon mustard optional\r\n- 2 tablespoons white distilled vinegar\r\n- 4 eggs\r\n- 4 smoked salmon slices\r\n- ½ cup spinach\r\n- 1 TB capers\r\n- Cayenne powder to taste\r\n- Pepper to taste",
    "instructions": "1. Preheat the oven to 450°. Toast English muffins OR hash browns for 4-5 minutes, until toasted and brown up top. Melt the butter in the microwave.\r\n\r\n2. Fill a large pot with water, and add salt and vinegar. Bring water to a boil: you should have noticeable steam rising off the surface of the pot without letting the water reach a simmering point. Place a large stainless steel bowl over the pot.\r\n\r\n3. Make the hollandaise sauce: To the stainless steel bowl, add Dijon mustard (optional), the 3 egg yolks, lemon juice, and a generous pinch of salt. Vigorously whisk the mixture until the egg yolks turn a pale yellow color and thicken in consistency, which will take about 1 to 2 minutes. Gradually pour in ½ cup of the warm butter, whisking continuously until the mixture becomes thick and creamy. Taste, and season with salt and cayenne powder. Remove bowl with hollandaise sauce and set aside.\r\n\r\n4. Poach the eggs: Break eggs into 6 ramekins. Lower the water to a simmer, avoiding a rolling boil. Using a slotted spoon, create a whirlpool motion in your pot. Next, place each egg, one at a time, in the center of the whirlpool. Cook by gently stirring occasionally in a clockwise motion, until the egg white is set while the yolk remains runny, which should take approximately 2 to 3 minutes (2 minutes will give you a perfectly runny yolk; 3 will give a semi-runny yolk with a set outer circle). Once the eggs are ready, take them out with a slotted spoon and set them to dry them off on a paper towel.\r\n\r\n5. To serve, line up 3 plates and place two halves of an English Muffin, or a Hashbrown on each plate. Top each serving with a few spinach leaves.\r\n\r\n6. Place two eggs on top of each serving. Top eggs with smoked salmon slices. Generously spoon hollandaise sauce over the whole thing.\r\n\r\n7. Lastly, sprinkle a few capers and garnish with cayenne powder on top of the sauce, and serve (leave the second half of the English muffins on the side).\r\n\r\n8. Leftover poached eggs will keep in an airtight container in the fridge for 2 days. Leftover hollandaise sauce will keep for 2 days as well.",

Juicy on the inside, a golden brown and crispy base, these are made in a skillet and are one of my all time favourite Japanese dishes! Watch the recipe video and you’ll be a Gyoza-Wrapping-Master in no time.",
    "ingredients": "Filling:\r\n- 1 1/2 cups green cabbage, very finely chopped\r\n- 1 tsp salt, separated\r\n- 1 lb / 500g ground pork (mince) (fattier the better)\r\n- 1 cup garlic chives, finely chopped (Note 1)\r\n- 1 garlic cloves, crushed\r\n- 1 tsp ginger, grated\r\n- 1 tsp sesame oil\r\n- 1 tbsp cornstarch / corn flour\r\n- 2 tsp soy sauce\r\n\r\nGyoza:\r\n- 1 tsp cornflour (cornstarch) – for tray\r\n- 40 – 45 round wonton (gyoza) wrappers (Gow Gee wrappers) – 1 1/2 packets (Note 2)\r\n- 3 tbsp vegetable oil (or other cooking oil)\r\n\r\nDipping Sauce:\r\n -Soy sauce\r\n -Rice wine vinegar\r\n- Chili oil (Rayu is Japanese chili oil)",
    "instructions": "1. Combine cabbage and 1/2 tsp salt in a small bowl, then set aside for 20 minutes to allow the cabbage to wilt slightly.\r\n\r\n2. Place remaining Filling ingredients (including remaining 1/2 tsp salt) in a large bowl. Squeeze out any excess water from the cabbage and add to the bowl.\r\n3. Use your hands to mix the Filling.\r\n\r\n4. Sprinkle a baking tray with 1 tsp of cornstarch / cornflour.\r\n\r\n5. Place 1 gyoza wrapper on your palm (left hand for right-handed people). Dip your finger in water and run it around the edge of half the gyoza wrapper (to seal).\r\n\r\n6. Place 1 slightly heaped tbsp of Filling on the wrapper. Fold wrapper over and use your right hand assisted by your left hand thumb to create 4 pleats. Press to seal and place on the tray. Repeat with remaining wrappers.\r\n\r\nTo Cook:\r\n1. Heat 1 tbsp oil in a large skillet (that has a lid) over medium high heat.\r\n\r\n2. Place about 12 gyoza in rows, slightly overlapping each other. Cook until the underside is light golden, then pour 1/3 cup of water around the gyoza and place the lid on.\r\n\r\n3.Cook until the water has completely evaporated (so the golden underside is not wet and soggy) and the wrapper is slightly translucent on top – about 3 to 4 minutes.\r\n\r\n4. Use an egg flip to transfer onto a plate upside down i.e. golden side up.\r\nServe with Dipping Sauce.\r\n\r\nDipping Sauce:\r\n\r\n1. Serve each ingredient separately so people can mix according to their taste. I use about equal portions of soy sauce and vinegar with a generous splash of chili oil.",

    "Name": "MARGHERITA PIZZA",
    "image": "margherita_HQw86LO.jpg",
    "author": "Nadia Lim",
    "description": "Margherita is the original pizza flavour, with just three toppings – tomato, basil and mozzarella; a simple, but sublime combination!",
    "ingredients": "Tomato sauce:\r\n- 2 tablespoons olive oil\r\n- 1 onion finely chopped\r\n- 2 cloves garlic finely chopped\r\n- 3 tablespoons tomato paste\r\n- 400 g crushed tomatoes one can\r\n- ½ teaspoon dried oregano or herbs\r\n- 1 teaspoon sugar \r\n\r\nPizza and toppings:\r\n- 2 large pizza bases*\r\n- 1 punnet cherry tomatoes halved\r\n- 1 to 1 ½ cups mozzarella grated or shredded\r\n- ¼ cup parmesan grated\r\n- 1 cup basil leaves torn\r\n\r\nPizza bases – makes 4 pizza bases\r\n- 250 ml lukewarm water\r\n- 1 tablespoon active dried yeast\r\n- 1 teaspoon sugar\r\n- 450 g high-grade flour\r\n- 1 tablespoon olive oil\r\n- 1 teaspoon salt",
    "instructions": "1. To make the pizza dough, put the water in a mixing bowl and add the yeast and sugar. Stir gently. Stand in a warm place until the yeast has dissolved and the mixture is frothy. Mix well.\r\n\r\n2. Place the flour, olive oil and salt in a large mixing bowl. Add the yeast mixture and mix well to form a dough (note: there may be some left over four in the bowl once you’ve formed the dough, this is fine). \r\n\r\n3. Knead the dough for 10 minutes until smooth and elastic, then place in an oiled bowl. Cover with a tea towel or clingfilm and place in a warm place to rise until doubled in bulk (about 40 minutes).\r\n\r\n4. Once it has risen, knock back the dough and divide into 4 even pieces. Use two pieces for this recipe, and freeze the other two pieces, wrapped well in clingfilm, to use at a later date. Of course you can always double this recipe and have more pizza though!\r\n\r\n5. Roll out each piece on a floured surface into a disc about 20cm in diameter (the thinner you can get the pizza base, the better). Your pizza bases are now ready!\r\n\r\n6. Preheat oven to 230degC. If you have them, place two pizza stones on separate shelves in the oven to preheat. Alternatively preheat 2 oven trays. Get them really hot (this helps the bases crisp up on the bottom).\r\n\r\n7. Heat olive oil in a medium fry-pan on medium heat. Sauté onion and garlic until soft, 3-4 minutes. Add tomato paste, crushed tomatoes, dried herbs and sugar. Simmer, uncovered, stirring occasionally, for 10-12 minutes until sauce is thick and the consistency of chutney. Season to taste with salt and pepper.\r\n\r\n8. Place each pizza base on a sheet of baking paper so that you can lift the pizzas easily once the toppings are on. Spread half of the tomato sauce on each pizza base. Arrange cherry tomatoes on each pizza. Sprinkle over mozzarella and parmesan.\r\n\r\n9. Carefully transfer the pizzas with baking paper to hot pizza stone or oven tray. Cook for 12-15 minutes until pizza bases are crisp and cheese has melted. Scatter over fresh basil leaves.",

    "Name": "BACON CHEESEBURGER",
    "image": "burger_infNl3A.jpg",
    "author": "Amelia Rampe",
    "description": "Growing up on the West Coast, I had two favorite burger chains. One was Carl’s Jr., the home of the Western Bacon Cheeseburger, a burger patty layered with cheese, bacon, bbq sauce, and onion rings. And of course there’s In-N-Out Burger, a chain known for its secret menu and for for using fresh ingredients.\r\n\r\nWhen I was creating this bacon cheeseburger I looked to both of those iconic burger joints for inspiration.",
    "ingredients": "- 8 slices regular bacon (7 to 8 ounces)\r\n- 1/4 cup mayonnaise\r\n- 1 tablespoon ketchup\r\n- 2 teaspoons sweet pickle relish\r\n- 1/2 small head iceberg lettuce\r\n- 1 large beefsteak or vine tomato (about 6 ounces)\r\n- 4 hamburger buns\r\n -2 tablespoons prepared yellow mustard\r\n- 1 pound ground chuck (80% lean)\r\n- 1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt\r\n- 1 teaspoons freshly ground black pepper\r\n -2 tablespoons vegetable or canola oil, divided\r\n- 4 slices cheddar or American cheese",
    "instructions": "1. Arrange a rack in the middle of the oven and heat the oven to 400ºF. Line a rimmed baking sheet with aluminum foil. Arrange 8 bacon slices in a single layer on the foil. Bake until browned and crisp, 19 to 20 minutes.\r\n\r\n2. Meanwhile, prepare the toppings and cook the burger patties. Place 1/4 cup mayonnaise, 1 tablespoon ketchup, and 2 teaspoons sweet pickle relish in a small bowl and stir to combine.\r\n\r\n3. Remove the leaves from 1/2 medium head iceberg lettuce until you have 8 burger-sized leaves. Using a serrated knife, slice 1 beefsteak tomato crosswise into 4 slices. Split 4 hamburger buns and spread 2 tablespoons yellow mustard on the cut sides of the top buns, evenly spreading it to the edges.\r\n\r\n4. Divide 1 pound ground chuck into 4 portions, then form each portion into a ball. Press each ball into a patty about 1/2-inch wider than the hamburger buns. Sprinkle the patties all over with 1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt and 1 teaspoon black pepper.\r\n\r\n5. Heat 1 tablespoon of the vegetable oil in a large cast iron skillet (at least 12 inches wide) or griddle over medium-high heat until shimmering. (If using a smaller skillet, cook the buns and burgers in 2 batches.) Tilt the pan so the oil coats the bottom. Place the mustard buns in the pan mustard-side down, gently press down on them, and cook until toasty and browned in spots, 2 minutes. Transfer to a plate.\r\n\r\n6. Place the bottom buns cut-side down in the pan and cook until golden brown and toasted, 45 seconds to 1 minute. Transfer to the plate with the mustard buns. Reserve the pan.\r\n\r\n7. When the bacon is ready, transfer to a paper towel-lined plate and cut or tear in half crosswise.\r\n\r\n8. Heat the remaining 1 tablespoon vegetable oil in the pan over medium-high heat until shimmering. Tilt the pan to coat the bottom with oil. Add the burger patties (cook in 2 batches if needed) and press on each patty with the back of a flat spatula. Cook until the bottoms are deeply browned and the patty is halfway cooked, about 2 1/2 minutes. Flip the burgers and place 1 slice of cheese on each patty. Cook for 2 to 2 1/2 minutes more, depending on desired burger doneness.\r\n\r\n9. Transfer to a plate and let rest for 5 minutes. Meanwhile, spread the mayonnaise mixture on the cut sides of the bottom buns, spreading to the edges.\r\n\r\n10. Assemble the burgers: Place a patty on each bottom bun. Top each patty with 4 bacon pieces, 1 tomato slice, 2 lettuce leaves, and the top bun.",

    "instructions": "Step 1:\r\nGather the ingredients. Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Peel and core apples, then thinly slice. Set aside.\r\n\r\nStep 2:\r\nMelt butter in a saucepan over medium heat. Add flour and stir to form a paste; cook until fragrant, about 1 to 2 minutes. Add both sugars and water; bring to a boil. Reduce the heat to low and simmer for 3 to 5 minutes. Remove from the heat.\r\n\r\nStep 3:\r\nPress one pastry into the bottom and up the sides of a 9-inch pie pan. Roll out remaining pastry so it will overhang the pie by about 1/2 inch. Cut pastry into eight 1-inch strips.\r\n\r\nStep 4:\r\nPlace sliced apples into the bottom crust, forming a slight mound. Lay four pastry strips vertically and evenly spaced over apples, using longer strips in the center and shorter strips at the edges.\r\n\r\nStep 5:\r\nMake a lattice crust: Fold the first and third strips all the way back so they're almost falling off the pie. Lay one of the unused strips perpendicularly over the second and fourth strips, then unfold the first and third strips back into their original position.\r\n\r\nStep 6:\r\nFold the second and fourth vertical strips back. Lay one of the three unused strips perpendicularly over top. Unfold the second and fourth strips back into their original position. Repeat Steps 6 and 7 to weave in the last two strips of pastry. Fold and trim excess dough at the edges as necessary, and pinch to secure.\r\n\r\nStep 7:\r\nSlowly and gently pour sugar-butter mixture over lattice crust, making sure it seeps over sliced apples. Brush some onto lattice, but make sure it doesn't run off the sides.\r\n\r\nStep 8:\r\nBake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce the temperature to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) and continue baking until apples are soft, 35 to 45 minutes.\r\n\r\nStep 9:\r\nServe and enjoy!",

    "image": "creme_brulee.jpg",
    "author": "Nagi",
    "description": "Here is a classic Crème Brûlée with a silky, smooth and rich custard topped with a thin pane of crunchy toffee. This is French chic personified in a dessert – classy but not stuffy, and oh-so-effortless! It takes just 4 simple ingredients: cream, egg yolks, sugar and vanilla. It’s an excellent make-ahead dessert for an elegant dinner party, yet easy enough to whip up for dinner tonight.",
    "ingredients": "- 2 cups pure cream (Aus) / heavy cream (US)\r\n- 1 vanilla pod OR 1 tsp vanilla bean paste\r\n- 5 egg yolks\r\n- 1/4 cup caster sugar (superfine sugar)\r\n\r\nToffee Topping:\r\n- 2 tsp caster sugar (superfine sugar)",
    "instructions": "Vanilla bean: Split vanilla pod down the middle and scrape the seeds out using a small knife. Place into saucepan with cream and the empty vanilla pod.\r\n\r\nInfuse cream: Simmer uncovered over low heat for 10 minutes. Remove from stove and set aside to infuse for 1 hour with lid on (you can skip this step if using paste, just let it cool to lukewarm). Remove vanilla pod. Skim off any skin that has formed on the surface.\r\n\r\nPreparation: Preheat oven to 130°C/265°F (120°C fan). Place 4 x ⅔ cup / 150 ml empty ramekins in a baking pan with high enough sides that enough water can be poured in to come halfway up ramekins.\r\n\r\nBoil water: Boil a kettle of water.\r\n\r\nWhisk egg yolks and sugar: Whisk yolks and sugar until just well combined. Don't whisk too much, as this can create bubbles.\r\n\r\nAdd cream: Pour cream into eggs and gently stir to combine. Divide mixture between ramekins with a soup ladle.\r\n\r\nWater bath: Pour in enough boiling water so it comes halfway up the sides of the ramekins. (If you have too much water, ramekins will float around – not good!)\r\n\r\nBake: Bake for 35 – 40 minutes, or until the custard is set but there is still a slight wobble when you GENTLY give the ramekin a little shake.\r\n\r\nChill: Remove ramekins from water. Leave to cool, then refrigerate for at least 6 hours and preferably overnight (up to 3 days is OK).\r\n\r\n- Toffee Topping -\r\nBlow torch method: Sprinkle 1/2 tsp sugar over the surface of each crème brûlée. Use a blow torch to melt and caramelise the sugar. Serve immediately.\r\n\r\nGrill / broiler method: Crème brûlée should be first refrigerated overnight. Preheat grill to high. Place crème brûlée under grill for 1 minute or until sugar is melted and caramelised. Refrigerate afterwards for at least 20 minutes and up to 1 hour (to reset custard immediately under toffee), then serve.\r\n\r\nCrème brûlée perfect texture: The texture should be like a very thick yogurt, rather than set so it is sliceable like cake or even like a soft set jelly. When you take a scoop, the custard should barely hold together, but shouldn't be melting or running. When you take a bite the custard should literally just melt in your mouth.",

    "description": "Falafel are delicious balls of chickpea and herb goodness that are crispy on the outside, yet soft and fluffy on the inside. They’re a staple in Middle Eastern cuisine and can be added to wraps, pitas, salads, and so much more. Bonus – I’ll show you how to make both fried falafel and baked falafel so you can choose your favorite method!",
    "ingredients": "- 1 cup dried chickpeas, soaked overnight (don't use canned chickpeas)\r\n- ½ cup roughly chopped onion\r\n- 1 cup roughly chopped parsley, about a one large bunch\r\n- 1 cup roughly chopped cilantro, about a one large bunch\r\n- 1 small green chile pepper, serrano or jalapeno pepper\r\n- 3 garlic cloves\r\n- 1 teaspoon cumin\r\n- 1 teaspoon salt\r\n- ½ teaspoon cardamom\r\n- ¼ teaspoon black pepper\r\n- 2 tablespoons chickpea flour (or other flour)\r\n- ½ teaspoon baking soda\r\n- oil for frying",
    "instructions": "Step 1\r\nSoak your dried chickpeas overnight or for at least 8 to 12 hours. Note that the chickpeas will triple in size, so cover them with plenty of water. Then drain and rinse them.\r\n\r\nStep 2\r\nPulse all the ingredients to a food processor. Add the chickpeas, onion, parsley, cilantro, garlic, green pepper, and spices to a food processor. I recommend roughly chopping up the onion, herbs, and pepper before adding for the best texture. Then, pulse the food processor but do not blend completely. The final mixture should resemble coarse sand.\r\n\r\nStep 3\r\nChill the falafel. Transfer the falafel mixture to a bowl and add the chickpea flour and baking soda. Stir together, then cover or add a lid and refrigerate the mixture for 30 minutes to one hour.\r\n\r\nStep 4\r\nShape the falafel. Use your hands, an ice cream scoop or falafel scoop to form the falafel into balls or patties. If you find the mixture is too wet, you can add another tablespoon of chickpea flour. If it's too dry and crumbly, you can add a teaspoon or two of water or lemon juice.\r\n\r\nStep 5\r\nCook the falafel. Once the falafel are formed, you can cook them by your preferred method mentioned above. To deep fry the falafel, add about 3 inches of oil to a pot on medium heat. Heat the oil to 350°F (175°C). Cook the falafel in batches (about 6 to 8 at a time) for 1 to 2 minutes or until golden.\r\n\r\nStep 6\r\nRemove the falafel. Use a skimmer to check the color of the falafel and make sure they don't overcook. Then remove them to a paper towel-lined plate.\r\n\r\nStep 7\r\nServe the falafel immediately, while warm and crispy on the outside. They're delicious served with tahini sauce as well.",

    "ingredients": "- Rice and veggies -\r\n1 ¼ cups short-grain brown rice or long-grain brown rice, rinsed\r\n1 ½ cups frozen shelled edamame, preferably organic\r\n1 ½ cups trimmed and roughly chopped snap peas or snow peas, or thinly sliced broccoli florets\r\n1 to 2 tablespoons reduced-sodium tamari or soy sauce, to taste\r\n4 cups chopped red cabbage or spinach or romaine lettuce or kale (ribs removed)\r\n2 ripe avocados, halved, pitted and thinly sliced into long strips (wait to slice just before serving, see details in step 5)\r\nEssential garnishes\r\n1 small cucumber, very thinly sliced\r\nCarrot ginger dressing\r\n\r\n- Essential garnishes -\r\nThinly sliced green onion (about ½ small bunch)\r\nLime wedges\r\nToasted sesame oil, for drizzling\r\nSesame seeds\r\nFlaky sea salt",
    "instructions": "1. Bring a large pot of water to boil (ideally about 4 quarts water). Once the water is boiling, add the rice and continue boiling for 25 minutes. Add the edamame and cook for 3 more minutes (it’s ok if the water doesn’t reach a rapid boil again). Then add the snap peas and cook for 2 more minutes.\r\nDrain well, and return the rice and veggies to the pot. Season to taste with 1 to 2 tablespoons of tamari or soy sauce, and stir to combine.\r\n\r\n2. Divide the rice/veggie mixture and raw veggies into 4 bowls. Arrange cucumber slices along the edge of the bowl (see photos). Drizzle lightly with carrot ginger dressing and top with sliced green onion. Place a lime wedge or 2 in each bowl.\r\n\r\n3. When you’re ready to serve, divide the avocado into the bowls. Lightly drizzle sesame oil over the avocado, followed by a generous sprinkle of sesame seeds and flaky sea salt. Serve promptly.\r\n\r\n4. If you intend to have leftovers, wait to complete step 4 just before serving (otherwise the avocado will brown too soon). Leftover bowls keep well (avocado excluded) for 4 to 5 days in the refrigerator.",

    "author": "Pailin Chongchitnant",
    "description": "if you’ve ever tried to make the Chinese style crispy pork belly with the bubbly skin, you know it’s not a quick and easy thing. Even with my recipe, which is one of the simplest out there, it's a 2-day process.\r\n\r\nThis is a Thai style fried pork belly that is unbelievably good, and it's only going to take you 30 minutes. I made this for a Thai friend, and after one bite and he said, \"You need to sell this!\" It was THAT good!",
    "ingredients": "- 1 lb pork belly, skinless\r\n- 1 ½ tablespoon fish sauce\r\n- 1 teaspoon sugar\r\n- ½ teaspoon ground white pepper\r\n- 2 tablespoon all-purpose flour\r\n- 2 tablespoon cornstarch\r\n- Frying oil, as needed",
    "instructions": "1. Pat the pork belly dry as much as possible with a paper towel, then remove the skin with a sharp knife, leaving as much of the fat on it as possible (unless you want to remove some of the fat).\r\n\r\n2. Cut the pork into 1-inch wide strips, and then cut each strip into pieces about ¾-inch thick. (The pork will shrink after frying so the final pieces will be smaller).\r\n\r\n3. Place the pork into a large mixing bowl and add the fish sauce, sugar, and white pepper. Use your hand to massage the pork and mix all the seasonings. Keep massaging for a minute or so until you no longer feel the grains of sugar, and there is no more fish sauce pooling at the bottom of the bowl.\r\n\r\n4. In a small bowl, combine the all-purpose flour and the cornstarch and mix well. Sprinkle the flour mixture over the pork and mix well, making sure none of the pieces are sticking together. You want a light and even coating on all the pieces. Let it sit for 5 mins or so while you heat up the oil.\r\n\r\n5. Add at least 1 inch of frying oil to a wok or a medium pot and heat it to 350°F (175°C) for the first fry.\r\n\r\n6.First Fry: Add half of the pork, placing it in the hot oil one piece at a time to ensure they are not sticking together. Fry for 2 minutes (time this). Maintain the heat of the oil between 300-350°F during the frying; on my electric stove I keep it on medium high, but it will vary from stove to stove.\r\n\r\n7. Remove the pork promptly and place on a plate to cool until it’s no more than lukewarm before frying them a second time. Repeat with the second batch, being sure to bring the oil temp back up to 350°F before frying.\r\n\r\n8. Second Fry: Once the pork is cool, bring the oil temp up to 385°F(196°C) over high heat. Add the pork all at once and fry for 70-90 seconds, or until the exterior is a deep golden brown. You can fry them for a maximum of 2 minutes; beyond this the pork will become too dry. Remove and place on a paper towel-lined plate to drain. Be sure to bring the temp back up to 385°F before frying the second batch.\r\n\r\n9. Allow the pork to cool for a few minutes before digging in as the fatty part of the pork is VERY hot out of the fryer!!",

Delicious, absolutely.\r\n\r\nHealthy? Not so much. But sometimes you need something a little indulgent for moments in your life that require a little something special.",
    "ingredients": "DOUGH\r\n¾ cup (180 grams) milk (whole milk or 2% preferred)\r\n2 ¼ teaspoons (one ¼-ounce package) quick-rise (instant) or active dry yeast*\r\n¼ cup (50 grams) granulated sugar\r\n4 tablespoons (57 grams) salted butter, melted and cooled\r\n1 large egg plus 1 large egg yolk, at room temperature\r\n3 cups (360 grams) bread flour, plus more as needed\r\n¾ teaspoon kosher salt\r\nExtra-virgin olive oil, for greasing the bowl\r\n\r\nFILLING\r\n4 tablespoons (57 grams) salted butter, softened\r\n⅔ cup (142 grams) packed dark brown sugar\r\n1 ½ tablespoons ground cinnamon\r\n\r\nCREAM CHEESE FROSTING\r\n4 oz (112 grams) cream cheese, softened\r\n¾ cup (85 grams) powdered sugar\r\n3 tablespoons salted butter, softened\r\n½ teaspoon vanilla extract",
    "instructions": "Step 1\r\nPrepare the dough: In a small microwave-safe bowl, warm the milk by microwaving it for 45 seconds to 1 minute, until it registers 115°F on a thermometer and feels like warm bath water.\r\n\r\nStep 2\r\nPlace the warmed milk in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment and sprinkle the yeast on top. (If using active dry yeast, add the sugar now and let the yeast sit with the sugar until foamy, about 5 minutes.) If you haven’t already, add the sugar, then the melted butter, egg, and egg yolk. Mix on medium speed until well combined, 30 seconds. (Alternatively, mix with a wooden spoon until well combined.) Remove the bowl from the mixer and use a wooden spoon to stir in the flour and salt until a dough begins to form (this will prevent flour from flying everywhere!).\r\n\r\nStep 3\r\nKnead the dough: Place the dough hook on the stand mixer and return the bowl to the mixer. Mix the dough on medium speed until it comes together and feels soft and slightly sticky, 8 to 10 minutes. If it’s too sticky—meaning it’s sticking to the bottom of the mixer—add another 1 to 3 tablespoons bread flour, 1 tablespoon at a time. (Alternatively, you can use your hands to knead the dough for 8 to 10 minutes on a well-floured surface.) Meanwhile, place a clean dish towel in your dryer to warm.\r\n\r\nStep 4\r\nLightly grease a large bowl with olive oil. Transfer the dough ball to the bowl, then cover with plastic wrap and the warm towel. Allow the dough to rise until doubled in size, 1 to 1½ hours. (This may be more or less time depending on the time of year, the humidity, and the temperature in your home.) You will know the dough has risen enough when you poke your finger into the dough about an inch without the indentation bouncing back immediately.\r\n\r\nStep 5\r\nGenerously dust a surface with flour. Turn out the dough and use a rolling pin to roll the dough into an 10 × 14-inch rectangle.\r\n\r\nStep 6\r\nPrepare the filling: Spread the softened butter over the dough, leaving a ¼-inch margin at the far short side of the rectangle. In a small bowl, mix together the brown sugar and cinnamon. Use your hands to sprinkle the mixture over the butter, then gently rub the brown sugar mixture into the butter.\r\n\r\nStep 7\r\nStarting from the short side without the margin, very tightly roll up the dough. Seal the far edge of the dough as best you can by pinching the dough together just slightly, then make sure the dough log is seam-side down. Cut a ½ inch off the ends of the dough, as the ends won’t have enough filling; feel free to discard (or bake separately as yummy extras). Use your hands to give the dough log a gentle push inwards on both ends so that it compacts slightly, as it may have stretched out a bit during the rolling process.\r\n\r\nStep 8\r\nUsing unflavored dental floss or a serrated knife, cut the dough into nine 1-inch slices.\r\n\r\nStep 9\r\nLine a round or square 9-inch pan with parchment paper. Place the rolls in the prepared baking pan. Cover with plastic wrap and a towel and let rise again until the rolls have puffed up, are doubled in size, and touching each other in the pan, 45 minutes to 1 hour.\r\n\r\nStep 10\r\nMeanwhile, preheat the oven to 350°F.\r\n\r\nStep 11\r\nBake the cinnamon rolls: Once the rolls have risen, remove the plastic wrap and towel and bake until golden brown on the edges, 20 to 25 minutes. Not overbaking the rolls ensures that they will stay soft in the middle. Cool for 10 minutes.\r\n\r\nStep 12\r\nPrepare the cream cheese frosting: In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment, combine the cream cheese, powdered sugar, butter, and vanilla. Beat on low speed for 30 seconds, then increase to medium-high speed until smooth and fluffy, 1 to 2 minutes. (Alternatively, whisk the frosting by hand.) Spread the frosting over the warm rolls and serve.\r\n\r\nStep 13\r\nTo store: Cover the whole pan with plastic wrap and foil or place individual cinnamon rolls in airtight containers or silicone bags and store in the fridge for up to 5 days. Reheat the cinnamon rolls individually in the microwave in 15 second intervals until warm.",

    "author": "Kristina Razon",
    "description": "Who doesn’t dream of lobster risotto? Think of the flavor being closer to dipping a lobster tail in butter vs a lobster bisque, where you would typically find lot of other lobster risotto recipes. Make this dish for Mothers day, the weekend, or whenever you just want to treat yourself to something a little more special. Like all my other risotto recipes this one does require a little attention, but in no way are you going to get an arm workout. Easy, and delicious.",
    "ingredients": "Butter Poached Lobster:\r\n- 1 stick butter\r\n- 1 tbsp water\r\n- 2 tbsp parsley minced\r\n- 3 4-5oz lobster tails\r\n\r\nLobster Risotto:\r\n- 5 cloves garlic minced\r\n- 1 shallot minced\r\n- 1 cup arborio rice\r\n- 3/4 cup dry white wine\r\n- 2 cups chicken broth\r\n- 2 1/2 cups water\r\n- 1/3 cup Parmesan cheese",
    "instructions": "Butter Poached Lobster:\r\n1. In a medium saucepan add the water, stick of butter, and minced parsley. Heat the butter to 160℉, keeping it in the 160℉-180℉ range. *If you don't have a candy thermometer let the butter mixture come to a light light simmer, and keep a careful eye on it.\r\n\r\n2. Remove the lobster meat from the shells by cutting along the top and bottom of the tail. Crack it open and carefully slip out the meat.\r\n\r\n3. When the butter is ready add the lobster meat. Cook for either 6-7 minutes if completely submerged or 2-3 minutes on each side. Lobster will be pearly and opaque when done. Remove from the pot, and rough chop when cooled.\r\n\r\nLobster Risotto:\r\n1. While the lobster meat is poaching make the broth. In a medium saucepan add the broth, water, a pinch of salt, and the lobster shells. Simmer for 15 minutes with the lid on.\r\n\r\n2. Add 4 tbsp of the lobster butter butter to a wide pot or pan on low heat. Add the garlic, shallots and approx. 1/2 tsp of salt and saute until soft and fragrant approx. 2-3 minutes.\r\n\r\n3. Add arborio rice and mix to combine. Toast rice for 3-4 minutes until it starts to become translucent.\r\n\r\n4. Add the wine and stir. Cook for 2-3 minutes before adding the first round of broth. Depending on the pan add broth until it just covers the risotto. (could be 1 cup to 1 1/2 cups). Give it a quick mix, a shake of the pan to ensure all grains are covered and cook until rice absorbs the majority of the broth. Mix every few minutes to avoid the rice from sticking.\r\n\r\n5. Add more broth and repeat above steps.\r\n\r\n6. Once almost all the broth has been added (approx. 4 cups), but not completely absorbed (15-18 minutes of cooking) give it a taste. Rice should still be loose, yet al dente. If it is still hard add more broth 1/4 cup at a time and cook down.\r\n\r\n7. Once done turn off the heat. Add the parm, lobster meat, and 2 more tbsp of lobster herb butter. Mix to combine and serve immediately.",

    "description": "As it turns out, most bartenders hate making espresso martinis (because not only do you have to make the cocktail, but you also have to pull a shot of espresso and cool it down fast), which is all the more reason to make your own at home. It really couldn’t be easier: Fill a cocktail shaker with ice; add vodka (psst, we asked three bartenders for their favorite brand), coffee liqueur, a shot of espresso, and simple syrup; then shake, strain, and enjoy.",

    "instructions": "If using espresso, prepare and let 1 ounce cool to room temperature, or refrigerate before using. Place a martini glass in the refrigerator or freezer for at least 5 minutes to chill.\r\n\r\nPlace the espresso or 1 ounce cold brew coffee, 2 ounces vodka, 1 ounce coffee liqueur, and 1/2 ounce simple syrup in a cocktail shaker. Add enough ice to fill the shaker halfway. Seal the shaker and shake vigorously until very cold and outside of the shaker is frosty, about 20 seconds. Pour through a strainer into the martini glass and garnish if desired.\r\n\r\nGarnish options:\r\nDecoratively place 1 or 3 coffee beans directly on top.\r\nFinely grate coffee beans with a Microplane over the top.\r\nPour finely ground coffee beans or instant espresso into a fine-mesh strainer and dust over the top. You can use this method with a piece of paper over half the cocktail to dust only one half for a more dramatic presentation.",

    "description": "I think some people find the idea of making cheesecakes daunting, especially ones where the biscuit crust comes up the side like this one. But you know what? In my humble opinion, cheesecake is easier to make than cakes.",
    "ingredients": "CHEESECAKE BISCUIT BASE:\r\n- 200g / 7 oz Arnott’s Marie crackers or other plain biscuit (Aus) or 28 Graham Cracker squares\r\n- 120g / 8 tbsp unsalted butter , melted\r\n\r\nCHEESECAKE FILLING:\r\n- 1 lb / 500g cream cheese , softened\r\n- 2 tbsp plain flour (all purpose flour)\r\n- 1 tsp vanilla extract\r\n- 1/2 cup sour cream (full fat)\r\n- 1 1/2 cups caster sugar (superfine sugar)\r\n- Zest of 1 lemon\r\n- 3 large eggs , at room temperature\r\n\r\nTOPPINGS:\r\n- Strawberries, blueberries, raspberries\r\n- Icing sugar / powdered sugar , for dusting",
    "instructions": "PREPARATION:\r\n1. Preheat oven to 160°C/320°F (140°C fan).\r\n\r\n2. Prepare pan – Get a 20cm/8\" springform cake tin. Turn the base UPSIDE DOWN (Note 4), butter lightly and place a square piece of parchment/baking paper on the base. Then clip into the springform pan – excess paper will stick out, see photos in post and video. Butter and line the side of the pan.\r\n\r\nCHEESECAKE BISCUIT BASE:\r\n1. Blitz – Break up biscuits roughly by hand and place in a food processor. Blitz until fine crumbs (Note 5). Add butter, briefly blitz until dispersed and it resembles wet sand.\r\n\r\n2. Press into pan – Pour into the prepared cake tin. Use a spatula to roughly spread it out over the base and up the walls. Use something with a flat base and vertical edges (I used a measuring cup) to press the crumbs up the wall almost to the top of the sides, and flatten the base.\r\n\r\nFILLING:\r\n1. Beat cream cheese – Use a mixer or beater to beat the cream cheese until smooth – about 30 seconds on medium high.\r\n\r\n2. Finish batter – Add flour, beat until just combined (10 sec). Add vanilla, sour cream, sugar and lemon zest. Beat until just combined (10 – 15 sec). Add eggs one at a time, beat in between until just combined (10 sec each). Don't over beat, we don't want to aerate the batter.\r\n\r\n3. Bake – Pour into prepared crust. Bake for 55 minutes. The top should be a very light golden brown, not cracked, and near perfectly flat. It should jiggle slightly when you gently shake the pan.\r\n\r\n4. Cool in the oven with the door open 20 cm / 8\" (Note 6), then refrigerate for 4 hours+ in the pan.\r\nRemove springform pan sides. Use overhang paper to slide cheesecake off the cake pan. Then slide the cheesecake off the paper.\r\n\r\n5. Serve – Top with berries and dust with icing sugar!",

    "instructions": "step 1\r\nA grazing board combines the best of a cheeseboard and charcuterie platter into one indulgent selection of food. There’s no strict recipe for a grazing board – simply gather together all your favourite nibbles, and arrange on a large platter or plate to share. You could do a mixture of meats and cheese, or go entirely vegetarian or vegan. The key things to remember when creating your platter, to make it look (and taste) as impressive as possible, are:\r\n\r\n- Make sure you assemble the board just before serving so everything is fresh\r\n\r\n- Always include crackers, breadsticks or bread to use as a vessel for cheeses or dips\r\n\r\n- Use small bowls or ramekins to hold small items and dips, like olives, nuts and chutneys\r\n\r\n- Use a good variety of ingredients. For example, aim for one hard and one soft cheese, two or three different cured meats, and a few varieties of fruits and nuts\r\n\r\n- If you use larger fruits, like figs or clementines, chop and tear them into different shapes, so that the fruit is easier to pick up and looks more appealing on the platter\r\n\r\n- Swirl any dips into ramekins, and top with olive oil, seeds or chopped herbs\r\n\r\n- Fill in any gaps on your platter with bay leaves or rosemary sprigs to decorate\r\n\r\n- Bundle any cured meats into nests, or roll or fold to create a variety of textures",
